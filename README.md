## Dataset Description
This dataset comes from the Phonbank English Providence Corpus from 2002-2005 by Katherine Demuth and her research assistants at Brown University. (https://phon.talkbank.org/access/Eng-NA/Providence.html)   
  The section I selected contains utterances from longitudinal audio/video transcripts of 6 monolingual English-speaking childrenâ€™s language development from 1-3 years during spontaneous interactions with their parents (usually their mothers) at home. The participants included 3 boys (Alex, Ethan, William) and 3 girls (Lily, Naima, Violet). Each child was recorded for 1 hour every 2 weeks beginning at the onset of first words.
